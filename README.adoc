= Providing metrics from a microservice

You'll explore how to provide system and application metrics from a microservice with MicroProfile Metrics.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use MicroProfile Metrics to provide metrics from a RESTful application.
Include metrics in an application to pinpoint issues, provide long-term trend data for
capacity planning, and provide proactive discovery of issues, such as disk usage growth without
bounds. Metrics can also help you schedule systems and decide when to scale the application to
run on more or fewer machines.

The application that you will work with is an `inventory` service
that stores information about various JVMs that run on different systems.
Whenever a request is made to the `inventory` service to retrieve the JVM
system properties of a particular host, the `inventory` service communicates with the `system`
service on that host to get the system properties. The system properties are then stored and returned.

Use MicroProfile Metrics to provide endpoints where you can get the metrics
results in a plain text format or JSON format. These endpoints have three scopes: `base`,
`application`, and `vendor`. The `application` scope is the focus for `inventory` application.

The metadata of the metrics in any scope has fields, such as unit, type, description, and more.
The type can be a counter, gauge, meter, histogram, or timer. You will use the counter, gauge, and
timer types in your application.

You can instrument an application in different ways, such as with injection, annotations, or by using
the `MetricRegistry` directly. In this guide, you will learn how to use annotations to register metrics to the
`inventory` application.

// =================================================================================================
// Getting Started
// =================================================================================================

== Getting started

Clone the Git repository. Then, run the following commands to use the starting project
in the `start` directory:

[subs="attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/OpenLiberty/draft-guide-microprofile-metrics.git
cd draft-guide-microprofile-metrics/start
----

// =================================================================================================
// Try what you'll build
// =================================================================================================

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory contains the finished metrics implementation
for the application. You can try it out before you build your own.

To try the application, navigate to the `finish` directory and run the following command:

```
mvn install liberty:start-server
```

Maven builds the application and runs it inside of Open Liberty.

Point your browser to the `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/` URL. Because you recently started the application,
hosts are not currently registered. Point to the `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost` URL to add a host. Next, Point to the
`https://localhost:9443/metrics` MicroProfile Metrics endpoint. Click the `Advanced` button to
proceed. Use the `confAdmin` and `microprofile` credentials to log in. You can see both the standard metrics and
the application metrics in Prometheus format. To see only the application metrics, point your browser to
`https://localhost:9443/metrics/application`. Because these metrics are application-related, you had
to point first to the `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/` URL, otherwise they will not appear.

```
# TYPE application:io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_properties_time_rate_per_second gauge
application:io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_properties_time_rate_per_second 0.08662540922169244
                                  .
                                  .
                                  .
# HELP application:io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_properties_time_seconds Time needed to get the properties of a system from the given hostname
                                  .
                                  .
# TYPE application:io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_inventory_size gauge
# HELP application:io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_inventory_size Number of systems in the inventory
application:io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_inventory_size 1
# TYPE application:list counter
# HELP application:list Number of times the list of systems method is requested
application:list 1
```

When you're done with the application, stop the Open Liberty server with the following command:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Now, navigate back to the `start` directory to begin.

// Adding Microprofile Metrics to the inventory application
// =================================================================================================

== Adding Microprofile Metrics to the inventory application

Navigate to the `pom.xml` file. In the `start/pom.xml` file, you can find the `microprofile-health-api`
dependency. Select this dependency to
use the MicroProfile Metrics API to provide metrics from your RESTful services. Also, the `javax.net.ssl.trustStore` system property is set to point to the SSL certificate.

Create a `start/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` file:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[tags=server]
----

The `mpMetrics-1.0` feature provides the `https://localhost:9443/metrics` endpoint.

To secure the endpoint, add basic security with the `quickStartSecurity` and `keyStore`
configuration elements. Use these credentials to view the metrics endpoint.

// =================================================================================================
// Adding the annotations
// =================================================================================================

=== Adding the annotations

Create the `/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java` class:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java[tags=InventoryManager]
----

You added the following metrics annotations:

The `@Timed` annotation applies to the `get()` method to track how frequently the method is
invoked and also how long it takes for the invocation to complete. This annotation is
followed by fields that correspond to metadata fields:

* The `name` field sets the name of the metric, which is the name of the annotated method by default.
* The `unit` field has a default value of `seconds`.
* The `description` field is optional and describes the purpose of the metric
annotation.

The `@Counted` annotation applies to the `list()` method. This annotation counts how many times
you request the list of systems methods by visiting `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` to
retrieve the information for a list of all previously registered hosts:

* The `absolute` field gives this annotation the name of the method.
* The `description` field is optional and describes the purpose of the metric annotation.
* The `monotonic` field is set to `true` to make the counter increment only.

The `@Gauge` annotation on the `getTotal()` method either tracks the inventory size or the number of systems that are stored
in the inventory. A system is stored in the inventory when you visit the
`http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost` URL to retrieve the information for a specific host:

* Specify the `unit` field. This annotation has no default value.
* The `name` and `description` fields are optional.

Note that, when the value of the gauge is retrieved, the underlying `getTotal()` annotated method is
called to return the value.

These annotations are registered by default to the `MetricRegistry` singleton object.
Through this object, they send metadata and metrics to the
`https://localhost:9443/metrics/application` endpoint, which is provided for you. Also, the
`@Counted`, `@Gauge`, and `@Timed` annotations can be placed in the Resource, such as
`InventoryResource`.

To create a RESTful application, see
https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service].

// =================================================================================================
// Building and running the application
// =================================================================================================

== Building and running the application

To build the application, run the Maven `install` goal from the command line:

```
mvn install
```

This goal builds the application, creates a `.war` file in the target directory, and
configures and installs Open Liberty into the `target/liberty/wlp` directory.

Next, run the Maven `liberty:start-server` goal:

```
mvn liberty:start-server
```

This goal starts an Open Liberty server instance. Your Maven `pom.xml` file is already configured to
start the application in this server instance.

When the server runs, navigate to the following URL to find the metrics endpoint that shows JVM and server base
details:

* `https://localhost:9443/metrics`

After you point your browser to `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems`, you can find specific
metrics about your application at the `https://localhost:9443/metrics/application` URL.

If you change the code, use the Maven package command to rebuild the application:

```
mvn package
```
The Open Liberty server that is running automatically picks up the changes.

To stop the server, run the Maven `liberty:stop-server` goal:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the metrics
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the metrics

You can test your application manually, but automated tests
trigger a failure whenever a code change introduces a defect. JUnit and the JAX-RS Client API
provide a simple environment for you to write tests.

First, create a `start/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/metrics/MetricsTest.java` test class:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/metrics/MetricsTest.java[tags=MetricsTest]
----

Place the `@BeforeClass` annotation on a method that executes before any of the test cases. In
this case, the `oneTimeSetup()` method retrieves the port number for the server and builds
a base URL string that is used throughout the tests.

Place the `@Before` and `@After` annotations on methods that execute before and after every
test case. These methods are generally used to perform any setup and teardown tasks.
In this case, the `setup()` method creates a JAX-RS client that makes HTTP requests to the
inventory service. Register this client with a `JsrJsonpProvider` JSON-P provider
to process JSON resources. The `teardown()` method destroys this client instance.

The following list describes the test cases that you can run:

* Use the `testGetPropertiesTime()` test case to test the `@Timed` annotation. This test case sends a request to the `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost` URL. The test verifies the `200` response code, which is returned with the `connectToEndpoint()` private method. Next, the test case makes a connection to the `https://localhost:9443/metrics/application` URL to get the content of the
metrics as plain text. The test case then uses the `validateMetric()` method to assert whether the time that is needed to get the system properties for `localhost` is less than 4 seconds.

* Use the `testListCount()` test case to test the `@Counted` annotation. This test case uses the `connectToEndpoint()` method to send a request to the `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` URL. Next, the test case uses the `validateMetric()` method to assert whether the `list()` method in the `InventoryManager` class was invoked once.

* Use the `testInventorySize()` test case to test the `@Gauge` annotation. This test case uses the `connectToEndpoint()` method to send a request to the `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost` URL. The inventory grows in size because of the request. The
`getHostCount()` method in the `InventoryManager` class returns one host, which represents the
localhost. The request then asserts the host with the `validateMetric()` method.

To execute the test cases in a particular order, put them in a `testSuite()` method.
Label the method with the `@Test` annotation, which automatically executes when your test class runs.

=== Running the tests

Go to the `start` directory and run the `mvn clean install` command. Two tests pass with the
following results:

```
-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.metrics.MetricsTest
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.778 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.metrics.MetricsTest
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.inventory.EndpointTest
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.128 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.inventory.EndpointTest

Results :

Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```

To see whether the tests detect a failure, go to the `MetricsTest.java` file and change the assertion values in the `validateMetric()` method. Rerun the Maven build. A test failure occurs.
