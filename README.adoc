= Providing metrics from a microservice

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

You'll explore how to provide system and application metrics from a microservice with MicroProfile Metrics.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use MicroProfile Metrics to provide metrics from a microservice. You can monitor
metrics to determine the performance and health of a service. You can also use them to pinpoint issues,
collect data for capacity planning, or to decide when to scale a service to run with more or fewer
resources.

The application that you will work with is an `inventory` service that stores information about various
systems. The `inventory` service communicates with the `system` service on a particular host to retrieve
its system properties when necessary.

You will use annotations provided by MicroProfile Metrics to instrument the `inventory` service to
provide application-level metrics data. You will add counter, gauge, and timer metrics to the service.

You will also check well-known REST endpoints that are defined by MicroProfile Metrics to review
the metrics data collected. Monitoring agents can access these endpoints to collect metrics.

// Try what you'll build
// =================================================================================================

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory contains the finished implementation for the application. You can try it out
before you build your own.

To try the application, navigate to the `finish` directory and run the following command:

```
mvn install liberty:start-server
```

Maven builds the application and runs it inside Open Liberty.

Point your browser to the `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` URL to access the `inventory`
service. Because you just started the application, the inventory is currently empty. Then, access the
`http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost` URL to add the localhost into the inventory.

Access the `inventory` service at the `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` URL at least once
for application metrics to be collected. Otherwise, the metrics will not appear.

Next, point your browser to the `https://localhost:9443/metrics` MicroProfile Metrics endpoint. Log in
as the `admin` user with `adminpwd` as the password. You can see both the system and application
metrics in a text format.

To see only the application metrics, point your browser to `https://localhost:9443/metrics/application`.

See the following sample outputs for the `@Timed`, `@Gauge`, and `@Counted` metrics:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
# TYPE application:inventory_properties_request_time_rate_per_second gauge
application:inventory_properties_request_time_rate_per_second 0.012564862395324394
# HELP application:inventory_properties_request_time_seconds Time needed to get the properties of a system from the given hostname
----
[source, role="no_copy"]
----
# TYPE application:inventory_size_guage gauge
# HELP application:inventory_size_guage Number of systems in the inventory
application:inventory_size_guage 1
----
[source, role="no_copy"]
----
# TYPE application:inventory_access_count counter
# HELP application:inventory_access_count Number of times the list of systems method is requested
application:inventory_access_count 1
----

To see only the system metrics, point your browser to `https://localhost:9443/metrics/base`.

See the following sample output for the `@Gauge` and `@Counted` metrics:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
# TYPE base:jvm_uptime_seconds gauge
# HELP base:jvm_uptime_seconds Displays the start time of the Java virtual machine in milliseconds. This attribute displays the approximate time when the Java virtual machine started.
base:jvm_uptime_seconds 39.025
----
[source, role="no_copy"]
----
# TYPE base:classloader_current_loaded_class_count counter
# HELP base:classloader_current_loaded_class_count Displays the number of classes that are currently loaded in the Java virtual machine.
base:classloader_current_loaded_class_count 9144
----

When you're done with the application, stop the Open Liberty server with the following command:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

== Adding MicroProfile Metrics to the inventory service

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

The MicroProfile Metrics API was added as a dependency to your `pom.xml` file. Look for the dependency with
the `mpMetrics` artifact ID. Add this dependency to use MicroProfile Metrics API
in your code to provide metrics from your microservices.

Next, create a `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` file:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[tags=server]
----

The `mpMetrics` feature enables MicroProfile Metrics support in Open Liberty. Note that this
feature requires SSL and the configuration has been provided for you.

The `quickStartSecurity` and `keyStore` configuration elements provide basic security to secure the
server. When you visit the `/metrics` endpoint, use the credentials defined in the server
configuration to log in to view the data.

// =================================================================================================
// Adding the annotations
// =================================================================================================

=== Adding the annotations

Create the `InventoryManager` class in the
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java[tags=InventoryManager]
----

Apply the `@Timed` annotation to the `get()` method to track how frequently the method is
invoked and also how long it takes for the invocation to complete. This annotation has these
metadata fields:

|===
|`name` | Optional. Use this field to name of the metric.
|`description` | Optional. Use this field to describe the purpose of the metric.
|`absolute` | Optional. Use this field to determine whether the metric name is the exact name that is specified in the `name` field or that is specified with the package prefix.
|===

Apply the `@Counted` annotation to the `list()` method to count how many times the
`http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` URL is accessed. Note the additional metadata field:

|===
| `monotonic` | Set this annotation to `true` to count the total number of invocations of the
annotated method, which is the total number of times the inventory is accessed.
|===

Apply the `@Gauge` annotation to the `getTotal()` method to track the number of systems that are stored in
the inventory. Note that when the value of the gauge is retrieved, the underlying `getTotal()` method
is called to return the size of the inventory. Note the additional metadata field:

|===
| `unit` | Set the unit of the metric. If it is `MetricUnits.NONE`, the metric name is used as is without appending the unit name, and no scaling is applied.
|===

Additional information about these annotations, relevant metadata fields, and more are available at
the https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-metrics[MicroProfile website].

Point your browser to the `https://localhost:9443/metrics` URL to review the all available metrics
that have been enabled through MicroProfile Metrics. Log in with `admin` as your username and
`adminpwd` as your password. You see only the system metrics because the server just started,
and the `inventory` service has not been accessed.

Next, point your browser to the `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` URL. Reload the
`https://localhost:9443/metrics` URL, or access only the application metrics at the
`https://localhost:9443/metrics/application` URL.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the metrics
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the metrics

You can test your application manually, but automated tests ensure code quality because they trigger a
failure whenever a code change introduces a defect. JUnit and the JAX-RS Client API provide a simple
environment for you to write tests.

First, create a test class in the `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/metrics/MetricsTest.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/metrics/MetricsTest.java[tags=MetricsTest]
----

* The `testPropertiesRequestTimeMetric()` test case validates the `@Timed` metric. It sends a request to the
`http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost` URL to access the `inventory` service, which adds
the `localhost` host to the inventory. Next, the test case makes a connection to the
`https://localhost:9443/metrics/application` URL to retrieve application metrics as plain text.
Then, it asserts whether the time that is needed to retrieve
the system properties for localhost is less than 4 seconds.

* The `testInventoryAccessCountMetric()` test case validates the `@Counted` metric. The test case sends a request to the
`http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` URL to retrieve the whole inventory, and then it asserts
that this endpoint is accessed only once.

* The `testInventorySizeGaugeMetric()` test case validates the `@Gauge` metric. The test case first ensures
that the localhost is in the inventory. It then looks for the `@Gauge` metric and asserts
that the inventory size is equal to 1.

The `oneTimeSetup()` method retrieves the port number for the server and builds a base URL string
to set up the tests. Apply the `@BeforeClass` annotation to this method to execute it before any of
the test cases.

The `setup()` method creates a JAX-RS client that makes HTTP requests to the `inventory` service.
Register this client with a `JsrJsonpProvider` JSON-P provider to process JSON resources. The
`teardown()` method destroys this client instance. Apply the `@Before` annotation so that a method
executes before a test case, and apply the `@After` annotation so that a method executes after a test
case. Apply these annotations to methods that are generally used to perform any setup and teardown tasks
before and after a test.

To execute the test cases in a particular order, put them in a `testSuite()` method.
Label the method with the `@Test` annotation, which automatically executes when your test class runs.

In addition, a few endpoint tests `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryEndpointTest.java`
and `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemEndpointTest.java` are provided for you to
test the basic functionality of the `inventory` and `system` services. If a test failure occurs, then you might have
introduced a bug into the code.
